            opportunity for Filipino students to learn, practice, and showcase
            their skills in software development. Students compete in a 12-hour
            long event where they build a website, app, or game that adheres to
            one of the three possible themes. At the end, the teams will present
            their projects to a panel of judges. The winners will recieve cash
            prize and the chance to sit down with NewCo Foundation Founder & CEO
            Dave Gross."
