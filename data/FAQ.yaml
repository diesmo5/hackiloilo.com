  answer: We will host a team formation event at the beginning of the hackathon so that no one has to hack alone (unless they want to). We allow teams of up to four hackers. If you do have a team, we will do our best to accept you all. Make sure ALL members apply and join the same team by using your unique team code.

  question: What should I bring?
  answer: Bring your student ID, computer, any external peripherals you may need (chargers, monitors, etc.), any other hardware that you definitely plan on using, and an open mind. Also bring a change of clothes, a toothbrush, and any other toiletries you may need. You may also bring a sleeping bag if you plan to nap.

  question: Are there any rules?
  answer: As a Major League Hacking member event, we are adopting Major League Hacking’s Code of Conduct, which requires you to respect others and help us keep Hack Iloilo a safe space for everyone. If you want your project to be considered for an award, you may only submit work that your team wrote during the hackathon.
